## 💬 Conversation Capabilities

### **Project-Related Queries**
```
User: "Tell me about the monitoring platform"
Assistant: "Bruno built a comprehensive monitoring platform using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry. This system provides real-time observability for cloud-native applications, including metrics collection, log aggregation, and distributed tracing. The platform was designed to handle high-scale production workloads with sub-second query response times and 99.9% uptime..."

User: "What technologies did you use and why?"
Assistant: "The monitoring platform leverages Kubernetes for orchestration, Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, Loki for log aggregation, and OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing. The infrastructure is deployed on AWS EKS with Terraform for IaC. We chose this stack because Prometheus excels at time-series metrics, Loki provides efficient log storage, and OpenTelemetry offers vendor-neutral observability standards. The combination ensures scalability, reliability, and vendor lock-in avoidance..."
